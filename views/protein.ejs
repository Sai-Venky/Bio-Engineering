  Proteins are large biomolecules, or macromolecules, consisting of one or more long chains of amino acid residues.<br> Proteins perform a vast array of functions within organisms, including catalysing metabolic reactions, DNA replication, responding to stimuli, and transporting molecules from one location to another. <br>Proteins differ from one another primarily in their sequence of amino acids, which is dictated by the nucleotide sequence of their genes, and which usually results in protein folding into a specific three-dimensional structure that determines its activity.<br>

  A linear chain of amino acid residues is called a polypeptide. A protein contains at least one long polypeptide. <br>Short polypeptides, containing less than 20â€“30 residues, are rarely considered to be proteins and are commonly called peptides, or sometimes oligopeptides.<br> The individual amino acid residues are bonded together by peptide bonds and adjacent amino acid residues.
